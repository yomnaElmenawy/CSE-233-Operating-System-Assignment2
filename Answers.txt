CSE233 – Assignment 2
Full Explanation of Lab 5 Exercises + Linker & Loader

Exercise 1 – Using fork() in C
We wrote process_creation.c that uses the fork() system call. 
When fork() is called, it creates a new child process. 
- If fork() returns 0 → we are in the child process
- If fork() returns >0 → we are in the parent and the number is the child's PID
- Both processes print their own PID using getpid()
This shows how a single program becomes two separate running processes.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exercise 2 – Starting Processes in the Background
We used: sleep 300 &
The "&" makes the command run in the background so the terminal stays free.
Then we used: jobs
This lists all background jobs and shows [1]+ Running sleep 300 &
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exercise 3 – Stopping Processes
We found the PID using: ps aux | grep sleep
Then killed the process using: kill <PID>
Finally verified it's gone with: ps aux | grep sleep (only shows the grep line)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exercise 4 – Pausing and Resuming a Process
We started a long sleep: sleep 1000 &
Then paused it with: kill -STOP <PID>
Checked status with jobs (shows "Stopped")
Then resumed with: kill -CONT <PID>
jobs showed "Running" again
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exercise 5 – Role of the Linker
We created two files:
file1.c → contains the hello() function
file2.c → contains main() that calls hello() but doesn't define it
Compiled with: gcc file1.c file2.c -o output_program
The linker combined both files and resolved the call from file2.c to hello() in file1.c
When we changed file1.c and recompiled, the new message appeared → proves the linker works
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Exercise 6 – Role of the Loader
We wrote simple_program.c with just a printf
Compiled it and ran: ldd simple_program
This showed:
- libc.so.6 → C library (provides printf)
- ld-linux-x86-64.so.2 → the dynamic loader itself
These libraries are loaded at runtime by the loader, not compiled into the program.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Job of the Linker:
The linker combines multiple object files (.o) into one executable file.
It resolves function calls and variables between different files.
Without the linker, file2.c wouldn't know where hello() is.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Job of the Loader:
The loader runs when we execute the program (./program).
It loads the executable into memory and dynamically loads shared libraries (like libc.so.6) that the program needs at runtime.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
All exercises were done exactly as shown in Lab 5.
Everything was tested on Ubuntu and works perfectly.
